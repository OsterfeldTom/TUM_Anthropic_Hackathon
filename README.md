## Assessment Criteria

The final Breakthrough Potential Score is calculated by weighting the following criteria, each rated on a scale from 1 to 5 (1 = strongest, 5 = weakest)

1. Novelty (empirical assessment using the Max Planck database)
2. Feasability
3. Scalability
4. Market Attractiveness
5. Competetive Advantage
6. Economic and Societal Impact
7. Strategic Fit for EU/Germany 
8. Time to Market
9. Team Strength
10. Risk vs. Return


Criteria 1, the novelty assessment is based on an empirical evauluation by accessing the Max Planck research database through the Logic Mill API. We measure the semantic similarity between a new idea and the global body of patents and research. A good score indicates few close matches (high novelty), while a low score reflects strong overlap with existing work.

The assessment of the criteria 2 - 10 is done by a claude agents.
